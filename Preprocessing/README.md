# PDF Processing Pipeline

This project provides a pipeline for processing PDF files. The pipeline scans a designated folder for PDFs, extracts and cleans text from each file, and splits the text into manageable chunks for further processing. It utilizes libraries such as [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) for PDF extraction and [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) for text processing.

## Prerequisites

- **Python Version:** This project requires Python 3.8 or higher.
- **Virtual Environment:** It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in the repository (which should include packages such as tqdm, pdfplumber, and nltk). Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure File Paths
Open the config.py file and adjust the following paths to match your system:
PDF_FOLDER: The absolute path where your PDF files are stored.
OUTPUT_FOLDER: The absolute path where processed files will be saved.
TEMP_FOLDER: A temporary folder inside the output folder for intermediate files.
Modify any other configuration settings as needed.
Project Structure

config.py
Contains configuration settings such as file paths, batch sizes, chunk sizes, and number of workers.
pdf_scanner.py
Scans the specified PDF directory, collects PDF file information, and writes an inventory file.
pdf_processor.py
Processes individual PDF files page by page. It extracts text, cleans it (removing stopwords using NLTK), and splits it into chunks.
batch_manager.py
Manages batch processing of PDF files using the inventory generated by the scanner. It processes PDFs in batches and logs successful and failed attempts.
main.py
The main entry point for the application. It sets up logging, creates necessary directories, initiates the scanning of PDFs, and triggers the batch processing.
requirements.txt
Lists the required Python packages for the project.
Running the Application

Once you have configured your paths and installed the dependencies, you can run the pipeline by executing:
python main.py
This command will:
Set up logging (with output to both the console and a rotating log file).
Scan the designated folder for PDFs.
Process the PDFs in batches, generating output files in the specified output folder.
Logging

The application uses Python's built-in logging module to record processing details. Log messages are output to the console and saved in a file named processing.log (using a rotating file handler to manage file sizes).
